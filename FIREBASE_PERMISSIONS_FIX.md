# ðŸ”¥ Firebase Firestore Setup Guide

## ðŸš¨ **URGENT: Fix "Missing or insufficient permissions" Error**

The error you're seeing indicates that Firebase Firestore security rules are blocking access to your database. Follow these steps to fix it:

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Step 1: Access Firebase Console**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `sui-off-and-on-ramp`
3. Click on **"Firestore Database"** in the left sidebar

### **Step 2: Initialize Firestore Database**
1. If you see "Get started with Cloud Firestore", click **"Create database"**
2. Choose **"Start in test mode"** (this allows all reads and writes for 30 days)
3. Select a location for your database (choose the closest to your users)
4. Click **"Done"**

### **Step 3: Configure Security Rules**
1. In Firestore Database, click on the **"Rules"** tab
2. Replace the existing rules with the following:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to all collections for development
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **"Publish"** to save the rules

### **Step 4: Verify Database Setup**
1. Go to the **"Data"** tab in Firestore
2. You should see an empty database
3. The database is now ready to accept connections

## ðŸ”§ **Alternative: Use Firebase CLI (Recommended)**

If you have Firebase CLI installed, you can deploy the rules automatically:

### **Install Firebase CLI**
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### **Login to Firebase**
```bash
firebase login
```

### **Initialize Firebase in your project**
```bash
firebase init firestore
```

### **Deploy Security Rules**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

---

## ðŸ§ª **Test the Fix**

After completing the setup, test the connection:

1. **Visit the Firebase Test Page**: http://localhost:3000/firebase-test
2. **Click "Run Firebase Tests"**
3. **Check the Firebase Diagnostic Page**: http://localhost:3000/firebase-diagnostic

You should now see:
- âœ… Connection Status: "Connected Successfully"
- âœ… No permission errors in the console

---

## ðŸ”’ **Security Rules Explanation**

The rules I provided allow **all reads and writes** for development purposes. This is temporary and should be updated for production:

### **Development Rules (Current)**
```javascript
match /{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if true;
}
```

### **Production Rules (Future)**
For production, you'll want more restrictive rules:
```javascript
// Only allow authenticated users to read/write their own data
match /transactions/{document} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
}
```

## ðŸš¨ **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "Project not found"**
- **Solution**: Verify you're using the correct project ID in your `.env.local`
- **Check**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=sui-off-and-on-ramp`

### **Issue 2: "Database not initialized"**
- **Solution**: Follow Step 2 above to create the Firestore database
- **Check**: Make sure you selected "Start in test mode"

### **Issue 3: "Rules not published"**
- **Solution**: Make sure you clicked "Publish" after updating the rules
- **Check**: Rules should show "Published" status

### **Issue 4: "Wrong project selected"**
- **Solution**: Double-check you're in the correct Firebase project
- **Check**: Project name should be "sui-off-and-on-ramp"

## ðŸ“ž **Need Help?**

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Firebase Console**: Make sure the database is created and rules are published
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: All Firebase config should be set in `.env.local`
3. **Test Connection**: Use the diagnostic page to identify specific issues
4. **Check Console Logs**: Look for specific error messages in browser console

## âœ… **Success Indicators**

You'll know the fix worked when:
- âœ… No "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors
- âœ… Firebase test page shows "Connected Successfully"
- âœ… You can see data in Firestore console
- âœ… Admin dashboard loads without errors

**The Firebase integration will work perfectly once the database is properly initialized!** ðŸš€
